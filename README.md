# Hi, my name is Anastasiia, and I am a web developer.

I am a web developer passionate about creating modern, functional websites and applications. My journey in web development started a few years ago when I discovered the world of website creation. Since then, I’ve mastered various technologies and developed a broader understanding of web applications, analyzing them as complete systems rather than just user interfaces.

## Technologies I Use

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Natif, Vue.js, Angular
- **Backend:** Node.js, Laravel, Next.js
- **Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Postman, API REST, Docker 

I’m passionate about optimizing user experience and creating smooth, high-performance applications.

## Interesting Projects

I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from simple landing pages to more complex web applications. One of the most interesting projects I’ve created is a questionnaire auto-evaluation system for a small business.

## GitHub and Contribution

I’m an active contributor to open-source projects on GitHub, where I share my solutions and learn new libraries and frameworks. I enjoy engaging with the community and contributing to meaningful projects.

## Goals

My goal is to continue growing as a developer, exploring new technologies, and creating innovative solutions that are helpful to users.

## Languages Spoken

I speak four languages: Russian, Ukrainian, French, and English. I love taking on challenges to learn different languages and test my abilities.

## Internship Search

I am currently looking for a 6-month internship starting in February! If you have any offers, feel free to contact me.

## Contact Me

For any proposals, collaboration opportunities, or questions about my background, skills, or a specific project, feel free to reach out through any of the following methods. I would be happy to exchange ideas, discuss professional opportunities, partnerships, or simply answer any questions. Don’t hesitate to get in touch—I’m available and open to any discussion.
